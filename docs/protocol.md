title: TacticalAPI
summary: 'TacticalAPI is a Bowire sibling plugin that wraps Rheinmetall''s situational-awareness gRPC interface with a bundled schema so the Situation service tree renders even without Server Reflection. Discovery, typed unary CRUD, server-streaming pump, mTLS via the shared __bowireMtls__ marker, IBowireMockEmitter for recording replay.'

  This page is this repository's contribution to https://bowire.io.

  Bowire's docs build fetches it into docs/protocols/tacticalapi.md and links it
  from the protocols navigation automatically — do not add a copy to the
  Bowire repository, it would be overwritten on the next build.

  It moved here because the behaviour it describes lives here: while the page
  sat in the Bowire repository, a claim about this plugin and the code making
  it true could only be fixed in two separate commits, and for one setting
  they drifted for weeks.

# TacticalAPI

The TacticalAPI plugin connects Bowire to Rheinmetall's situational-awareness gRPC interface: bundled-schema discovery (no Server Reflection on the target needed), typed unary invoke for `GetSituationObjects` / `AddOrUpdateSituationObjects` / `DeleteSituationObjects`, the server-streaming pump for `SubscribeSituationObjectEvents`, URL-scheme normalisation (`tacticalapi@host:port`, `grpc(s)://`, bare `host:port`), and mTLS via the shared `__bowireMtls__` marker alongside the legacy `_bowire:client-cert-pfx` keys.

The TacticalAPI plugin connects Bowire to [Rheinmetall's **TacticalAPI**](https://github.com/Rheinmetall/tacticalapi) &mdash; a gRPC interface for situational-awareness systems. The plugin ships the upstream service schema bundled with the package, so Bowire can render the `Situation` service tree against any TacticalAPI server **even when the server does not expose gRPC Server Reflection**.

**Package:** `Kuestenlogik.Bowire.Protocol.TacticalApi` (sibling repo, not bundled with the CLI)

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package Kuestenlogik.Bowire.Protocol.TacticalApi
```

Bowire discovers the plugin automatically via assembly scanning &mdash; no extra registration code.

## Use

```bash
bowire --url tacticalapi@my-situation-server:50051
```

Open the workbench, pick the **TacticalAPI** tab, and the four methods of the `Situation` service (`SubscribeSituationObjectEvents`, `GetSituationObjects`, `AddOrUpdateSituationObjects`, `DeleteSituationObjects`) appear in the sidebar. Click **Execute** on any unary method and the call goes out to the server; pick the streaming method and the workbench's Wireshark-style frame pane starts filling with `SituationObject` events as they're emitted.

### URL forms

The plugin normalises the URL Bowire passes through:

| You type | What the plugin connects to |
|---|---|
| `tacticalapi@host:4267` | `https://host:4267` (default — TacticalAPI in the field is mTLS) |
| `grpc://host:50051` | `http://host:50051` (plaintext gRPC) |
| `grpcs://host:50051` | `https://host:50051` |
| `host:4267` | `https://host:4267` |

### mTLS / TLS settings via metadata

TacticalAPI servers in production almost always run behind mTLS. The plugin reads two configuration keys from the workbench metadata bag — these never reach the wire (they're filtered out before the gRPC `Metadata` is built):

| Metadata key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `_bowire:tls-skip-validation=true` | Accept any server certificate. For staging / self-signed only — same opt-in semantics as the core gRPC plugin's `--allow-self-signed-certs`. |
| `_bowire:client-cert-pfx=<path>` | Path to a PFX file with the client certificate + private key. |
| `_bowire:client-cert-password=<pw>` | Password for the PFX (omit for unprotected PFX). |

Set both via the workbench's metadata panel before clicking **Execute**, or via `--metadata _bowire:client-cert-pfx=...` from the CLI.

### Pairing with the gRPC plugin's gRPC-Web transport

TacticalAPI servers commonly expose **two ports**: a native HTTP/2 gRPC endpoint (typically `:4267`) and a gRPC-Web endpoint (typically `:4268`) for browser-fronted clients. Bowire's [gRPC plugin](grpc.md#grpc-web-transport) speaks both — point at the native port for full bidirectional access, or at the gRPC-Web port behind an L7 proxy. Discovery works against either transport because the proto schema is bundled, not fetched at connect time.

## Licensing &mdash; please read

The plugin code, generated bindings package, and documentation are **Apache-2.0**. The upstream TacticalAPI `.proto` files at <https://github.com/Rheinmetall/tacticalapi> are **EPL-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause** (Rheinmetall Electronics GmbH). Vendoring those files into an Apache-2.0 repository would be redistribution under a different license, which EPL-2.0 does not permit. To honour both:

- The `.proto` files are **downloaded at build time** from the upstream repository (pinned commit `e68546809d981cd649325dba4a9702c1a77a1a0b`) into `obj/tacticalapi-protos/` &mdash; gitignored, never committed.
- `Grpc.Tools` compiles them into the assembly; **only the generated C# bindings** ship in the NuGet package.
- The `.proto` source itself never enters the plugin's source tree or its published package.

The pin will move to a released tag once Rheinmetall cuts one. A scheduled GitHub Action in the sibling repo (`.github/workflows/check-upstream-protos.yml`) runs weekly, compares the pinned commit against `Rheinmetall/tacticalapi@main`, and opens a tracking issue when upstream drifts &mdash; so the bump cadence stays visible without manual polling.

## Build requirements

Building the plugin **requires outbound internet access** to `raw.githubusercontent.com` so the proto-fetch target can reach the upstream repo. GitHub Actions runners have this by default; air-gapped CI does not.

### Air-gapped builds

Pre-populate the proto cache before invoking `dotnet build`:

```text
<repo-root>/artifacts/obj/Kuestenlogik.Bowire.Protocol.TacticalApi/<Configuration>/tacticalapi-protos/rheinmetall/tactical_api/v0/
```

Drop the six upstream `.proto` files (same filenames as on `Rheinmetall/tacticalapi`) into that directory and the build's `DownloadFile` target short-circuits because the files already exist. Consumers of the **published NuGet package** don't need network access &mdash; only contributors and CI building from source do.

## Try it — upstream test client as data populator

Rheinmetall ships an [official C# test client](https://github.com/Rheinmetall/tacticalapi/tree/main/testclient/csharp) alongside the proto set. It's a small CLI that exercises every operation in `Situation` &mdash; `--observesituation` (server-streaming), `--printsituation` (unary polling), `--sendsymbol` (create), `--changesymbolname` (update), `--deletesymbol` (delete). For Bowire users the test client is the fastest way to **populate a server with realistic data** so the workbench has something interesting to render.

End-to-end demo, against either a live TacticalAPI server or the upstream `TacNet` instance:

```bash
# 1. Build the upstream test client (one-time)
git clone https://github.com/Rheinmetall/tacticalapi
cd tacticalapi/testclient/csharp
dotnet build TacticalApi.TestClient.csproj

# 2. Place a handful of symbols at WGS84 coordinates near Hamburg
#    (the test client takes lat / lon as positional args)
dotnet TacticalApi.TestClient.dll --sendsymbol 53.5 9.9
dotnet TacticalApi.TestClient.dll --sendsymbol 53.55 10.0
dotnet TacticalApi.TestClient.dll --sendsymbol 53.6 10.05

# 3. Add the optional map-widget extension so SituationObjectLocation
#    pins land on a MapLibre canvas next to the streaming-frames pane.
#    (Skip this step if you only want the raw JSON view — Bowire still
#    auto-detects the lat/lon fields, it just falls back to a
#    "Install Kuestenlogik.Bowire.Map" placeholder card instead of a map.)
dotnet add package Kuestenlogik.Bowire.Map

# 4. Point Bowire at the same server — native HTTP/2 transport
bowire --url grpc@https://localhost:4267
#    …or gRPC-Web over HTTP/1.1 if the server exposes :4268 too
bowire --url grpcweb@https://localhost:4268

# 5. In the workbench, pick Situation → SubscribeSituationObjectEvents.
#    Click Execute. With the Frame-Semantics Framework live in
#    Bowire 1.3.0+, the workbench auto-detects the lat/lon fields on
#    every SituationObjectLocation and mounts a Map tab next to the
#    streaming-frames pane — every symbol the test client created
#    appears as a pin, every new --sendsymbol from a parallel
#    terminal lights up live.
```

Why this demo carries weight: **no Bowire-side configuration was involved**. No `bowire.schema-hints.json`, no `IBowireSchemaHints` implementation, no manual right-click on a field. The TacticalAPI plugin ships transport-only; the framework recognises `coordinate.latitude` / `coordinate.longitude` from the field names + WGS84 ranges and routes the data into the map widget on its own. The pgAdmin pattern: shape-of-data drives viewer choice, not protocol-author opt-in. The map widget itself rides its own NuGet package (`Kuestenlogik.Bowire.Map`) so Bowire core stays ~870 KB lighter for users who never need geographic rendering &mdash; same plugin model as the protocol packages.

A companion walkthrough in **[the mock-server docs](../features/mock-server.md#external-client-validation)** uses the same test client to validate `bowire mock` &mdash; a useful inverse comparison if you ever want to verify Bowire reproduces a real server's behaviour faithfully.

## Roadmap

- **v1.0.0 (shipped 2026-05-26)** &mdash; bundled-schema discovery, typed unary CRUD (`GetSituationObjects` / `AddOrUpdateSituationObjects` / `DeleteSituationObjects`), the server-streaming pump for `SubscribeSituationObjectEvents`, URL-scheme normalisation (`tacticalapi@`, `grpc(s)://`, bare `host:port`), mTLS via the shared `__bowireMtls__` marker (legacy `_bowire:client-cert-pfx` keys still honoured for back-compat), `IBowireMockEmitter` for recording replay, in-process Kestrel-hosted integration suite. The current stable line.
- **post-1.0** &mdash; MIL-STD-2525 / APP-6 symbol renderer (the schema's `SymbolIdentifier` field is already wired through; the map widget side needs a [milsymbol.js](https://github.com/spatialillusions/milsymbol)-style renderer to turn the SIDC into the correct tactical-affiliation glyph). Service-Bus / Artemis-flavoured AMQP 1.0 discovery (parallel item on the AMQP plugin's side) could similarly land as a vendor-specific follow-on.

## Sample

A canonical mini-server lives at [`Bowire.Protocol.TacticalApi/samples/Kuestenlogik.Bowire.Protocol.TacticalApi.Sample`](https://github.com/Kuestenlogik/Bowire.Protocol.TacticalApi/tree/main/samples/Kuestenlogik.Bowire.Protocol.TacticalApi.Sample) &mdash; the same RadarSweep (three MIL-2525C contacts orbiting a radar centre at 54.00&deg;N / 11.50&deg;E), now folded into a *combined* sample that also mounts the embedded workbench at `/bowire` on port 5191. `dotnet run`, then open <http://localhost:5191/bowire> (the `Situation` service is pre-seeded), or point an external Bowire at `http://localhost:5191` and pick `Situation` to exercise `GetSituationObjects` (unary) + `SubscribeSituationObjectEvents` (server-streaming). For a full Harbor Control Center scene with the AddOrUpdate / Delete RPCs and gRPC-Web on a second port, see the harbor-demo sibling [`Bowire.Samples/harbor-demo/src/Kuestenlogik.Bowire.Samples.TacticalApi`](https://github.com/Kuestenlogik/Bowire.Samples/tree/main/harbor-demo/src/Kuestenlogik.Bowire.Samples.TacticalApi).
